# lss tools

Tools to parse and analyze LiveSplit `.lss` files. At the moment it supports only command, `deviation`

## deviation
Calculates [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) on each segment history to figure out which splits are the least consistent. You can specify lower bound on the attempt id, so that you can not account for very old segment times.

### deviation example
In [example-splits/4ms.lss](./example-splits/4ms.lss), we find that attempt 171 is the beginning of a recent set of attempts:
```xml
    <Attempt id="170" started="11/15/2020 05:53:01" isStartedSynced="True" ended="11/15/2020 05:56:00" isEndedSynced="True" />
    <Attempt id="171" started="12/22/2020 14:35:54" isStartedSynced="True" ended="12/22/2020 14:40:47" isEndedSynced="True" />
```

So, we are interested in how inconsistent we have been since then:
```
$ ./lss.py deviation example-splits/4ms.lss --minattemptid 171
Mean           Median         Deviation      Split Name
00:00:29.240   00:00:26.357   00:00:06.687   Aspid Arena
00:00:36.560   00:00:34.905   00:00:05.799   Grub 1
00:01:20.848   00:01:23.652   00:00:05.703   Mawlek
00:00:32.208   00:00:30.440   00:00:03.983   Grub 2
00:00:27.295   00:00:27.315   00:00:03.245   Grub 5
00:01:01.773   00:01:02.115   00:00:02.565   Gruz Mother
00:00:51.717   00:00:51.971   00:00:02.285   Grub 3
00:00:37.165   00:00:37.335   00:00:01.425   Shard 2
00:01:12.335   00:01:12.369   00:00:01.330   Dirtmouth
00:00:20.408   00:00:20.129   00:00:00.998   Grub 4
00:00:48.470   00:00:48.472   00:00:00.742   Shard 3
00:00:21.781   00:00:21.635   00:00:00.610   Shard 4
00:00:10.054   00:00:09.914   00:00:00.455   Shard 1
```

This tells us that, when we do segment practice, we should focus on `Aspid Arena`*, `Grub 1`, and `Mawlek`.

*_In these splits, `Aspid Arena` includes a hazard respawn after the acid grub. Missing the respawn loses a lot of time._

âš  **If you have recently added splits in the middle of other splits, be sure `minattemptid` is after that point**
